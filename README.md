# Predictive Analysis using Random Forest and GridSearchCV
The main objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of distinguishing whether a TikTok video contains a factual claim or expresses an opinion. A successful prediction model will enable TikTok to streamline the processing of user reports, prioritizing them more effectively by leveraging machine learning to predict a binary outcome variable.

The purpose of this model is to mitigate misinformation in videos on the TikTok platform.

The goal of this model is to predict whether a TikTok video presents a "claim" or an "opinion".

This project follows the PACE framework (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute) and is divided into three parts:
